  |   Colors!                                                               |

  |   Use the numbers around the side of the puzzle to work out how many    |
  |   blocks of which color should be painted in each row and column.       |
  |   Since the order of the numbers doesn't determine the order you need   |
  |   to paint the colors you'll need to stretch your brain to figure it    |
  |   out. Luckily there are two types of numbers that indicate if the      |
  |   colors should be painted together or separately.                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Smaller puzzles ease you into this new way of thinking and you'll     |
  |   soon be hooked, working your way through 6 color packs with 50        |
  |   puzzles in each, ranging in size from 5x5 to 15x10.                   |
